# Build and Run Automation

The building and execution processes of the game are fairly simple.  
To start the game, the user just has to execute the command:
```
$ make snek
```

This will install the necessary dependencies, compile the binary object, run it, and clean the workspace afterwards.

## Enjoy the game! ;D
